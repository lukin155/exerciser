# Exerciser
A framework to create exercises by removing parts of code and leaving them for students to fill in.

For usage, see the demo folder, i.e. exerciser_demo.m and submit_demo.m. Call the exerciser demo before calling the submit demo since the exerciser demo generates the "student's files" which the submit demo will examine.
